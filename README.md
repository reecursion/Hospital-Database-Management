The project is aimed at developing a Hospital database to store and manipulate patient records and their blood test details. The first frame is the home page where options are provided for five different functions:
- Adding a new patient record
    a. With blood test details if the test has been taken.
    b. Without blood test details.
- Displaying patient records by:
    a. Searching for the required patient record.
    b. Displaying all records with each record on a different frame.
- Updating a patient record.
- Analysing the blood test results of a patient.
- Exiting the application.
